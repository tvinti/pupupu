<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
      Elias Norwood’s journey into the wild began before he ever held a camera. Growing up near the rugged coasts of Norway, he developed an early bond with the natural world—its cold winds, silent forests, and breathtaking skies. As a child, he would wander off on long solo walks into the fjords, sketching what he saw in a worn leather-bound notebook. Photography became his medium at age thirteen, when a neighbor gifted him a second-hand film camera. Since then, Elias has devoted his life to capturing the raw and poetic essence of nature, not just as it is, but as it feels in the quiet corners of the soul.
</p>
<p>
      He studied environmental aesthetics and visual storytelling at the Oslo School of Arts, where he deepened his understanding of the interplay between ecology and emotion. While his peers focused on urban installations and performance art, Elias began taking extended solo treks into northern forests, coastal islands, and arctic plateaus. His goal was to become invisible—to blend into the landscape and document moments that most people would never witness: a fox curled beneath snowfall, northern lights brushing the edge of a ridge, or the slow blink of a moose at sunrise.
</p>
<p>
      Over the next decade, Elias built a career not around fame or recognition, but around integrity. He declined commercial offers that clashed with his ethics, and instead published limited photo journals, hosted intimate exhibitions, and taught workshops on ethical nature observation. His most iconic body of work, "The Breathing Earth," was compiled over six years, spanning 11 countries and hundreds of raw environments. The project featured slow, observational imagery paired with handwritten field notes—an artistic testament to patience and presence.
</p>
<p>
      In 2019, Elias temporarily stepped back from travel due to a near-fatal fall in the Swedish highlands. During recovery, he focused on writing—publishing a memoir entitled "Silence in the Lens," which became a modest Scandinavian bestseller. The book shared deeply personal reflections on fragility, solitude, and healing through stillness. The same themes began influencing his later works, which shifted from grand landscapes to more intimate close-ups: bark textures, insect wings, frozen moss in morning frost.
</p>
<p>
      Today, Elias resides in a converted wooden cabin outside Tromsø, where he lives with his dog Bris and a rescued owl named Natt. He rises before dawn, often walking three to five kilometers before sunrise with camera in hand. He still avoids mainstream social media, preferring to share his work via slow-post newsletters, hand-printed zines, and curated collaborations with eco-focused museums and schools.
</p>
<p>
      For Elias, photography is not just craft—it is philosophy. He believes that to photograph nature is to engage in a form of listening. His work whispers rather than shouts. It does not seek applause, but connection. And through his lens, we are reminded that the quiet places of the earth still breathe—and so must we.
